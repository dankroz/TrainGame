# TrainGame

This project allows users to check on trains to get their names, destinations, frequencies, upcoming arrivals and how far away each train is. It also allows users to add new trains with their information to the list. 

It is useful for users to be able to check on these made up trains to see which train they can catch and when.

The Train Scheduler stores information in Firebase for the database.
